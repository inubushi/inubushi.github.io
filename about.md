I am a geek who strives to make intelligent software that help people. As an interaction designer, I also look for ways to make apps easy and fun to use.

I code a lot for work, and a bit for fun. I have shared some of my code [here]https://github.com/inubushi, and also at [Yubi's GitHub page]https://github.com/Yubi-interactions, in case anyone finds it useful.
