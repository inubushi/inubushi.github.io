Kids with autism find it troublesome to keep track of time and end up taking a lot of time even for simple tasks. If you are a parent of an autistic kid, you know how much time is wasted while waiting for him to finish what he/she is doing.

Mom's Timer is designed to help motivate autistic kids to finish what they are doing. Simply set the duration, and also a photo of any reward that the child will get if he finishes in time. The timer will start hiding the photo gradually, giving the child an idea of the remaining time and the consequences of dilly-dallying.

We made Mom's Timer to help a child who had trouble learning words, and found it very helpful. We now share it with you for free, and hope it will help many more kids!
