Automatically recognizing people's activity by analyzing videos can save a lot of time when there is a need to go through a lare amount of surveillance camera video. Some researchers have tried this using deep learning approaches.

While there are a few good research papers on how to use deep learning for human activity recognition in video, I am yet to see a good demo that can get a beginner started. So, I thought of creating one.

Check out my repository [LSTM-KTH](https://github.com/inubushi/LSTM-KTH) for an example of using convolutional neural networks and LSTM recurrent neural networks for recognizing activity in the KTH dataset.
