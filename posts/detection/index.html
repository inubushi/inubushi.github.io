    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In the previous post, we learned what Image Classification is. To remind in
simple terms, Image classification is the task of identifying the category of
the <em>dominant object</em> in an <em>image</em> (photo, or camera preview). There is a
list of categories that the <em>classifier</em> knows how to distinguish between,
and the dominant object HAS TO belong to one of them, for meaningful results.</p>
<p>Image classification does have a variety of applications. For example, It can be
used on a production line, to see if the product under the camera is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or
&ldquo;defective&rdquo;. But in some applications, classification is not good enough.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a surveillance camera that we want to connect to an AI, to
automatically analyze the human behavior in the view of the camera. Image
classification can tell you that <em>a person is currently dominating the image</em>,
when one does. It may not be able to identify that one or more persons are
present in the view, until one gets sufficiently close to the camera.
Information about the number of people will not be available. Obviously, this
does not fit many applications in automatic surveillance.</p>
<p><em>Image detection</em> is the technology required for this kind of tasks. In image
detection, the AI detects the positions of all instances of known objects.
The image below shows an example of detecting different obects in a photo.</p>
<p><img src="/images/detection_result.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The following are some importnt observations coming from this image:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>each detected object belongs to one of the classes that the detector has been
trained to identify</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multiple objects from the same class are detected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for each detected object, the bounds of a rectangle around the object
(called <em>bounding box</em>) is provided as output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bounding boxes can overlap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the area outside the bounding boxes is considered as <em>background</em> by the
detector</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A good example for image detection is available
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_objects_in_live_capture">here</a>
under Apple&rsquo;s documentation on the <em>Vision framework</em>. This demo runs on live
camera preview and recognizes several categories of breakfast items.</p>
<p>However, the example is a bit difficult to understand for a beginner, because
of more complicated code fro running on live preview. The number of things that
it can detect is also limited. In the next post, I will provide you with the
source code for a detector that is a bit more versatile, with a bit less code.</p>
